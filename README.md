# Udacity Data Analyst Term 2 Project 1: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon


In this project, I investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. The project was about learning to analyze experiments, create a hypothesis and apply inferential statistics to drive conclusions.

# How to run the script
You can run the script using a Python integrated development environment (IDE). This code is written in Python 3, so you will need the Python 3.x version of the installer. To read the file, the following software requirements apply:

- You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas, matplotlib and spicy installed using Anaconda
- Jupyter Notebook

# Datasets
The dataset contains a sample of 24 entries. The variables used are:

- congruent 
- incongruent 

After downloading the datasets, place them in the same folder with this Python script.

# Files
- Test a Perceptual Phenomenon.ipynb
- Test a Perceptual Phenomenon.html
- stroopdata.csv
- stroop-test-2.jpg

# Findings 
The analysis indicates that there is a statistic significant difference on the average time spend on the exercice between the congruent and incongruent test group. Since our p-value is lower than our trashhold of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. Thus, our test indicates that there is statistical evidence in the duration of solving the task depending on the group.
    
 The statistical analysis confirms the same cluster as the visual anlysis in chapter 4.
